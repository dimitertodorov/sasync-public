module Sasync::SymmetricEncryption
  # Write to encrypted files and other IO streams
  #
  # Features:
  # * Encryption on the fly whilst writing files.
  # * Large file support by only buffering small amounts of data in memory
  # * Underlying buffering to ensure that encrypted data fits
  #   into the Symmetric Encryption Cipher block size
  #   Only the last block in the file will be padded if it is less than the block size
  class Writer
    # Open a file for writing, or use the supplied IO Stream
    #
    # Parameters:
    #   filename_or_stream:
    #     The filename to open if a string, otherwise the stream to use
    #     The file or stream will be closed on completion, use .initialize to
    #     avoid having the stream closed automatically
    #
    #   options:
    #     :compress [true|false]
    #          Uses Zlib to compress the data before it is encrypted and
    #          written to the file
    #          Default: false
    #
    #     :header [true|false]
    #          Whether to include the magic header that indicates the file
    #          is encrypted and whether its contents are compressed
    #
    #          The header contains:
    #             Version of the encryption key used to encrypt the file
    #             Indicator if the data was compressed
    #          Default: true
    #
    #     :version
    #          Version of the encryption key to use when encrypting
    #          Default: Current primary key
    #
    #     :mode
    #          See File.open for open modes
    #          Default: 'w'
    #
    # Note: Compression occurs before encryption
    #
    #
    # # Example: Encrypt and write data to a file
    # Sasync::SymmetricEncryption::Writer.open('test_file') do |file|
    #   file.write "Hello World\n"
    #   file.write "Keep this secret"
    # end
    #
    # # Example: Compress, Encrypt and write data to a file
    # Sasync::SymmetricEncryption::Writer.open('encrypted_compressed.zip', :compress => true) do |file|
    #   file.write "Hello World\n"
    #   file.write "Compress this\n"
    #   file.write "Keep this safe and secure\n"
    # end
    #
    # # Example: Writing to a CSV file
    #  require 'fastercsv'
    #  begin
    #    # Must supply :row_sep for FasterCSV otherwise it will attempt to read from and then rewind the file
    #    csv = FasterCSV.new(Sasync::SymmetricEncryption::Writer.open('csv_encrypted'), :row_sep => "\n")
    #    csv << [1,2,3,4,5]
    #  ensure
    #    csv.close if csv
    #  end
